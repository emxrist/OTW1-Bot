  <h1>Privacy Policy – OTW1 Bot</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines what data is (and is not) collected or processed by OTW1 Bot on Discord.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>OTW1 Bot only processes the following information, temporarily and as needed for functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User IDs and message content (during slash command execution only)</li>
    <li>Guild (server) IDs, channel IDs, and roles (for command logic)</li>
    <li>Match statistics (e.g., for `/status`) stored temporarily in memory or database</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>No persistent user data is stored outside the Discord platform unless strictly required for bot features. If any storage is used, it is minimal and used exclusively for features like tracking stats or matches.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No user data is ever sold, shared, or transmitted to third parties. OTW1 Bot operates solely for Discord functionality and no analytics or advertising tools are integrated.</p>

  <h2>4. User Control</h2>
  <p>If you wish to remove your data or have concerns, you may contact the developer directly via Discord. You may also remove the bot from your server at any time to cease data processing.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to secure any data handled by the bot and prevent unauthorized access. However, the nature of Discord bots means some data passes through Discord’s servers, which are governed by <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of OTW1 Bot constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

  <p>If you have questions, please contact the bot developer via Discord.</p>
