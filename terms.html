  <h2>1. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You must use the Bot in compliance with Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a>. You are responsible for all activity associated with your account and servers where the Bot is present.</p>

  <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Functionality and Availability</h2>
  <p>OTW1 Bot is provided "as is" and may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time without notice. We make no guarantees of uptime, performance, or compatibility.</p>

  <h2>4. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to remove or restrict access to OTW1 Bot from any user, server, or region at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these Terms or misuse of the Bot.</p>
